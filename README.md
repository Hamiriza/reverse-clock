# reverse clock

![reverse clock screenshot](/ReverseClockReadmeBanner.png 'Screenshot')

This app is using React and is based on boilerplate code generated by `reactjs-boilerplate` package to bootstrap development.

The `ReverseClock` component is located under `src/components`.

## Assumptions

- The input range for DECREMENT_BY_SECS is between 1 and 60.
- The clock starts enabled, counting with decrement of 1 from current time.
- There is no need for input validation since a range control was used which restricts the values to valid ones only.

## Usage

### Docker

Build the image with the following command:

```
docker build . --tag reverseclock
```

Then create a container using:
```
docker run --name reverseclock -t -p 5000:5000 reverseclock
```

#### `npm start`

It bundles your files in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
